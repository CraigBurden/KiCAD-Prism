"""The one place a Wave 3 consumer opens its revision's design bundle.

A consumer calls :func:`bundle_read` with the member paths it needs. The answer
is a :class:`BundleRead` when every requested member has a final answer
(bundle-format.md §3.3). Otherwise the request does not fall back to a legacy
reader (R1 deleted them); it raises a typed answer the API renders the same way
for every route (ADR §8, §9.7 R1):

- a member is not ready yet (``pending`` or ``unavailable``): the
  ``design_bundle`` job is queued, deduplicated on the bundle key, and
  :class:`DesignDataPending` is raised (HTTP 202) -- unless the build ended
  in a failure no retry is answering, which raises :class:`DesignDataFailed`;
- a member failed, the project is absent at that revision, or the bundle could
  not be opened: :class:`DesignDataFailed` is raised (HTTP 422).

``skipped`` and ``not-applicable`` are final answers the consumer handles itself
(e.g. a project without a board); they do not fall back either.

A request without a ``commit`` reads the checkout's ``HEAD`` (``reader``
treats ``None`` as HEAD). If the checkout holds uncommitted changes in the
files the bundle reads, HEAD's bundle is still served and
:meth:`BundleRead.response_headers` says so; a bundle is never built from a
dirty working tree.
